    <h2>
      Discipline
    </h2>
    <p> The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
      for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
      to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
      rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
      safe. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
    learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done	
    through:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li> Positive	reinforcement</li>
  <li> Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction</li>
  <li> Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.</li>
  <li> Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings</li>
  <li> Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner.</li>
  <li> Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Parent-Teacher Confrences</h2>
<p> Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
  students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
  group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
  informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
  and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
  Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
  curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
  child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
  read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.</p>

  <h2>Extra Help</h2> 

  <p> If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
    of ways, which may include:</p>
    <br> 
    <ul>
      <li> Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
        process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
      <li> Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
      <li>  Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
      <li> Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
      <li> Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
        order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
        <li> Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
          concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
    </ul>
