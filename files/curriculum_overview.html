    <p> The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
      for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
      to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
      rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
      safe. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
    learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done	
    through:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li> Positive	reinforcement</li>
  <li> Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction</li>
  <li> Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.</li>
  <li> Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings</li>
  <li> Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner.</li>
  <li> Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences. </li>
</ul>
